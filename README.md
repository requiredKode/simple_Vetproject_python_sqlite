# Veterinary Project
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/vu6Yfuy4d4k>
#### Description:
This project consists of a registration platform for pet owners and their pets to be attended through appointments,
this platform will be used only by the veterinary staff to make the relevant records of customers who require attention to their pets,
so the operation of the application is given as follows.

Instructions:
The first thing you need to do in case you do not have an account on the platform, is to register,
with which you must enter the necessary data to make such registration.

Once registered, proceed to log in with a user name and password previously entered in the registration process.

Once logged in, we will have the main view of the platform which has a table showing the registered appointments
with important data such as the pet owner's name, the pet's name, a description of the problem or disease that the pet presents,
as well as the date on which the appointment will be assigned, we also have a button that will allow us through the aforementioned data,
create a new appointment record, all this data can be edited or deleted as the situation warrants, and an access to log out of the account to log out.

If we access the side menu, we find access to the profile data of the logged in user in case he/she wants to modify his/her data, we also find the access
to the owner control and pet control which both show the respective tables to visualize the important data we need, these are pet owner data and pet data
to keep a record of all the clients that the veterinarian attends, then we can also make a new owner or pet record as well as update the data or delete them
according to the need.

It should be understood that the main page of the platform will always be to view appointments, so when accessing Home from the menu, this will redirect us to
this page mentioned above, finally there is an access to about me, this page shows thank you information.
